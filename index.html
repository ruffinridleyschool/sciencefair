  <h2>Calling all scientists!</h2>

  <p>
    <b>NOTE: Fair Date Change</b><br>The theme of this year's fair is <b>"The Earth"</b>, and the in-person Fair 
    is Saturday, May 22nd (rain date the 23rd) at 8AM at the FRR School soccer field.  The
    entire school, pre-K through 8th grade, even those who may have 
    particpated in the virtual fair, are welcome to participate.

  </p>

  <h2><u>Fair Date/Time: May 22, 2021 at 8:00 AM</u></h2>
    
  <p>
    Due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the date, format, and
    location (virtual/indoors/outdoors) of the main fair in May is subject 
    to change. The PTO will announce any changes in fair date and location in the coming
    weeks. Though an in-person fair has been planned for the date and time above, if circumstances change, that fair could be held virtually.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> your project does <em>not</em> have to be
    about The Earth. Your project should be about whatever you are excited about!
