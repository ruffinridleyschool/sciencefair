  <h2>Calling all scientists!</h2>

  <p>
    The theme of this year's fair is <b>"The Earth"</b>, and the Virtual Fair--for 
    6th, 7th, and 8th graders--is this Saturday, March 13th at 7PM. You will 
    need to choose an Avatar to move around the fair and interact virtually, and
    we encourage you to try it out early to you'll be ready for the fair.  Just
    click the "Virtual Fair" button above.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will also be an outdoor, in-person fair on <b>May 8th, 2021 at 9AM</b>
    for the entire school, pre-K through 8th grade, even those who may have 
    particpated in the virtual fair.
    Fill out the <a href="register.html">registration form</a> to sign up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Due to uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the date, format, and
    location (virtual/indoors/outdoors) of the main fair in May has not been
    confirmed. The PTO will announce the fair date and location in the coming
    weeks or months. At a minimum, that fair will also be held virtually.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Please note:</strong> your project does <em>not</em> have to be
    about The Earth. Your project should be about whatever you are excited about!
